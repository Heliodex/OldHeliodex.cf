					<h3 class="lexend">DocSocial</h3>

					<p class="lexend">
					Docsocial is a free, secure messaging application. It is designed to appear like a Google document from a quick glance, or from a look at your browser history.<br>
					<br>
					DocSocial uses <a href="https://Scaledrone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scaledrone</a> for its backend and for transferring messages.<br>
					<br>
					It was designed to work best with one specific device and OS, our school-assigned chromebooks, so pupils could chat with others in class and not be caught by a teacher.<br>

					<h3 class="lexend">HybridOS</h3>

					<p class="lexend">
					HybridOS was an open-source Python3 'meta-program'.<br>
					I avoid calling it an operating system, because... it's not an operating system, it was written in Python.<br>
					<br>
					HybridOS was worked on from mid- to late-2019 as a fusion of two similar programs, BlakBird by me, and Vortex by Taskmanager. (<a href="https://taski.ml/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">taski.ml</a>)<br>
					The program has a total line count of more than 1,100, and had features such as a multi-user signup and login system, a number of games and useful applications, plenty of colourful ASCII art, and a root admin system.<br>
					HybridOS was ported to many different languages, including C, C++, Java, C# (twice), and Batch. Even linux distros were made as well!<br>
					<br>
					HybridOS was largely abandoned after the beginning of 2020, and the code for the first Python version has been released under The Unlicense on my GitHub page.<br>

					<h3 class="lexend">PF Range Calculator</h3>

					<p class="lexend">
					This is a small web tool designed to calculate how far weapons in the game Phantom Forces by StyLiS Studios deal a certain amount of damage to.<br>
					You can input some values provided by the in-game statistics, and the tool will calculate how far it will deal that damage to.<br>
					<br>
					This was created by me in a few days, after I realised how long it would take to calculate all the range values manually.<br>
					<br>
					You can find the calculator at <a href="https://pfcalc.heliodex.cf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PFCalc.Heliodex.cf</a> .<br>

					<h3 class="lexend">Crazy Calculations</h3>

					<p class="lexend">
					Crazy Calculations was a simple maths game that would test you through 10 levels of increasingly difficult maths questions.<br>
					It was programmed in about a week for a Computer Science class assignment, where a video had to be recorded explaining the project.<br>
					The project was started on 23 September 2021, and submitted on 4 October 2021.<br>
					<br>
					The game was inspired by (and much of the code ported from) <a href="https://www.tomscott.com/usvsth3m/maths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You Can't Do Simple Maths Under Pressure</a> by UsVsTh3m.<br>
					<br>
					Crazy Calculations is playable at <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/7557207546/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roblox.com/games/7557207546</a> .<br>

					<h3 class="lexend">Python Calculator Collection</h3>

					<p class="lexend">
					This is a collection of calculator programs I wrote on my calculator's python interpreter during maths classes.<br>
					There are programs for calculating interest over time, areas or volumes of polytopes, angles of arcs of circles, and much more.<br>
					<br>
					I cannot and will not guarantee the accuracy of these programs, but while they <em>should</em> be decently accurate, please submit an issue to the repo if you find an error in any of the programs.<br>
					They are available at <a href="https://github.com/Heliodex/PythonCalculators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub.com/Heliodex/PythonCalculators</a> .<br>
