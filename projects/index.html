					<h3 class="lexend">DocSocial</h3>

					<p class="lexend">
					Docsocial is a free, secure messaging application. It is designed to appear like a Google document from a quick glance, or from a look at your browser history.<br>
					<br>
					DocSocial uses <a href="https://Scaledrone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scaledrone</a> for its backend and for transferring messages.<br>
					<br>
					It was designed to work best with one specific device and OS, our school-assigned chromebooks, so pupils could chat with others in class and not be caught by a teacher.<br>
					<br>

					<h3 class="lexend">HybridOS</h3>

					<p class="lexend">
					HybridOS was an open-source Python3 'meta-program'.<br>
					I avoid calling it an operating system, because... it's not an operating system, it was written in Python.<br>
					<br>
					HybridOS was worked on from mid- to late-2019 as a fusion of two similar programs, BlakBird by me, and Vortex by Taskmanager. (<a href="https://taski.ml/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">taski.ml</a>)<br>
					The program has a total line count of more than 1,100, and had features such as a multi-user signup and login system, a number of games and useful applications, plenty of colourful ASCII art, and a root admin system.<br>
					HybridOS was ported to many different languages, including C, C++, Java, C# (twice), and Batch. Even linux distros were made as well!<br>
					<br>
					HybridOS was largely abandoned after the beginning of 2020, and the code for the first Python version has been released under The Unlicense on my GitHub.<br>
